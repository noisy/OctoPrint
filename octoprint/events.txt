Add to the "system:" section of config.yaml

There are two types of event handlers at the moment: 
	system: invokes an external command without waiting for the result
	gcode: sends some gcode to the printer.  Separate multiple commands with a comma

Example: 
		system: 
		  events:
		  - event: Connected
			type: gcode
			command: M115,M17 printer connected!,G28
		  - event: Disconnected
			type: system
			command: python ~/growl.py -t mygrowlserver -d "Lost connection to printer" -a OctoPrint -i http://rasppi:8080/Octoprint_logo.png
		  - event: PrintStarted
			type: system 
			command: python ~/growl.py -t mygrowlserver -d "Starting _FILE_" -a OctoPrint -i http://rasppi:8080/Octoprint_logo.png
		  - event: PrintDone
			type: system 
			command: python ~/growl.py -t mygrowlserver -d "Completed _FILE_" -a OctoPrint -i http://rasppi:8080/Octoprint_logo.png

command values support the following dynamic tokens:
		_DATA_ 		- the data associated with the event (not all events have data, when they do, it's often a filename)
		_FILE_ 		- filename of the current print (not always the same as _DATA_ filename)
		_LINE_ 		- the current GCode line
		_PROGRESS_ 	- the percent complete
		_ZHEIGHT_ 	- the current Z position of the head
		_NOW_		- the date and time of the event
