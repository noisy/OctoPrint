Issues, Tickets, however you may call them
------------------------------------------

Read the following short instructions **fully** and **follow them** if you want your ticket to be taken care of and not closed again directly!

- Always create **one ticket for one purpose**. So don't mix two or more feature requests, support requests, bugs etc into one ticket. If you do, your ticket will be treated as if only describing the first purpose, the others will be ignored!
- If you want to report a bug, **READ AND FOLLOW [How to file a bug report](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/How-to-file-a-bug-report)!** Tickets will be automatically checked if they comply with the requirements outlined in that wiki node! Other then what's written in there (**and really EVERYTHING that is written in there!**) you don't have to do anything special with your ticket.
- If you want to post a **request** of any kind (feature request, documentation request, ...), **add [Request] to your issue's title!**
- If you need **support** with a problem of your installation (e.g. if you have problems getting the webcam to work), **add [Support] to your issue's title!**. Note that for problems like these, the [Mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/group/octoprint) or the [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/102771308349328485741) will probably get you help faster!
- If you have a general **question**, **add [Question] to your issue's title!**. Note that for problems like these, the [Mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/group/octoprint) or the [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/102771308349328485741) will probably get you help faster!
- If you have another reason for creating a ticket that doesn't fit any of the above categories, think hard if it might not be something better suited for the [Mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/group/octoprint) or the [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/102771308349328485741). If you are sure it needs to be reported here, **add [Misc] to your issue's title!**

Following these guidelines (**especially EVERYTHING mentioned in ["How to file a bug report"](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/How-to-file-a-bug-report)**) is necessary so the tickets stay manageable - you are not the only one with an open issue, so please respect that you have to **play by the rules** so that your problem can be taken care of. Tickets not playing by the rules **will be closed without further investigation!**.

Pull Requests
-------------

1. Please create all pull requests against the `devel` branch.
2. Create **one pull request per feature/bug fix**.
3. Create a custom branch for your feature/bug fix and use that as base for your pull request. Pull requests directly against your version of `devel` will be closed.
4. In your pull request's description, state what your pull request is doing, as in, what feature does it implement, what bug does it fix.
