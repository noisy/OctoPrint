Issues, Tickets, however you may call them
------------------------------------------

- If you want to report a bug, **READ [How to file a bug report](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/How-to-file-a-bug-report)!** Tickets will be automatically checked if they comply with the requirements outlined in that wiki node!
- If you want to post a **request** of any kind (feature request, documentation request, ...), **add [Request] to your issue's title!**
- If you need **support** with a problem of your installation, **add [Support] to your issue's title!**
- If you have a general **question**, **add [Question] to your issue's title!**
- If you have another reason for creating a ticket that doesn't fit any of the above categories, **add [Misc] to your issue's title!**

Pull Requests
-------------

1. Please create all pull requests against the `devel` branch.
2. Create **one pull request per feature/bug fix**.
3. Create a custom branch for your feature/bug fix and use that as base for your pull request. Pull requests directly against your version of `devel` will be closed.
4. In your pull request's description, state what your pull request is doing, as in, what feature does it implement, what bug does it fix.
