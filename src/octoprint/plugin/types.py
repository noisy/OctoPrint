class BlueprintPlugin(Plugin):
	"""
	The ``BlueprintPlugin`` mixin allows plugins to define their own full fledged endpoints for whatever purpose,
	be it a more sophisticated API than what is possible via the ``SimpleApiPlugin`` or a custom web frontend.

	The mechanism at work here is `Flask's <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ own `Blueprint mechanism <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/blueprints/>`_.

	Your plugin should define a blueprint like this:

	.. code-block:: python

	   template_folder = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), "templates")
	   blueprint = flask.Blueprint("plugin.myplugin", __name__, template_folder=template_folder)

	Use your blueprint just like any other Flask blueprint for defining your own endpoints, e.g.

	.. code-block:: python

	   @blueprint.route("/echo", methods=["GET"])
	   def myEcho():
	       if not "text" in flask.request.values:
	           return flask.make_response("Expected a text to echo back.", 400)
	       return flask.request.values["text"]

	Your blueprint will be published by OctoPrint under the URL ``/plugin/<pluginname>/``, so the above example
	would be reachable under ``/plugin/myplugin/echo`` (given that you named your plugin "myplugin"). You'll be able
	to create URLs via ``url_for`` under the prefix that you've chosen when constructing your blueprint, ``plugin.myplugin``
	in the above example:

	.. code-block:: python

	   flask.url_for("plugin.myplugin.echo") # will return "/plugin/myplugin/echo"

	OctoPrint Blueprint plugins should always follow the naming scheme ``plugin.<plugin name>`` here
	to avoid conflicts.
