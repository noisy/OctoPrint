== Cura 12.11 ==
* Bugfix: Critical, printing window does not open without a webcam attached under windows.

== Cura 12.10 ==
* Update: Vastly updated serial port and baudrate auto-detection. No longer tries to reset the machine multiple times which improves detection success to 100%. And tries last succesful settings first.
* Added: Loading splashscreen
* Added: Support printed with dual extruder
* Removed: Dwindle, did remove some stringing, but caused holes in the models.
* Added: Retraction on/off checkbox on first tab of normal mode. So you no longer need to mess with the retraction length. A default retraction length of 4.5mm has been added.
* Fixed: Unicode support in filenames
* Added: Split up long moves into moves of 3mm, this to improve reaction speed of speed changes, and give better time left estimates during printing.
* Removed: Odd calculation which caused retraction on every Z move
* Fixed: SF bug with fillet plugin (but fillet not accessable from Cura)
* Added: Two example models, the Ultimaker robot, and the Ultimaker handle. Ultimaker robot is loaded on first start
* Added: Support for *.obj files
* Fixed: Batch runner tool shows slightly better how far it is done, and no longer starts more threads then objects you try to slice.
* Removed: Black console window for windows
* Updated: "First run wizard" huge update on the machine check, which is now stable and easier to follow.
* Update: Created a tool menu, which contains the batch run tool, the project planner, and the switch to quickprint. So this is no longer hidden in the file menu.
* Added: Heated bed temperature option support. If you have a heated bed, enable the heated bed setting in the preferences.
* Update: 3D view is now Ultimaker blue instead of black&white
* Added: Support for timelaps webcam capture during USB printing (Windows only)
* Added: Extrusion/retraction buttons to USB printer interface
* Added: Error log in case something goes wrong during USB printing. For easier diagnostics what is going wrong.
* Update: Temperature graph now shows a grid to indicate the scale
* Fixed: Project planner bug when slicing all at once, the bug caused the printer head to move into the print.
* Added: Default temperatures for printing in quickprint mode
* Update: Quickprint vase mode only had 2 bottom solid layers, updated to 3 to give a much bigger chance of being watertight
* Update: Improved loading speed for complex models
* Fixed: Loading of ascii-stl files with Mac lineends
* Update: Adjusted the quickprint low quality profile a bit, so it produces stronger parts
* Added: Ultimaker 3D platform for scale reference
* Added: COLLADA .dae support, for better compatibility with SketchUp
* Improved: MacOS .app build for easier install and start
* Added: Postprocessing plugins

== Cura 12.08 ==
* Added: Loading STL files from the commandline
* Added: Open STL files on doubleclick for Windows
* Update: Numpy for math heavy 3D calculations, speeds up model loading, rotation and size calculations
* Added: Setting to configure the 3D model colour
* Update: Default print temperture of 230C
* Update: Start/End code for cleaner prints
* Update: Slightly improved serial auto-detection code
* Added: Temperature graph in printing interface
* Added: Forced sending line on comm timeout, so printing always continues.
* Added: Draw model borders feature
