Skeinforge_PyPy is a set of patches for different versions of Skeinforge. Made to make use of PyPy easier.
The code consists out of a few patches and a build script.

The final result is a release package for Windows which should be ready to run without any additional requirements.

====What is changed====
* All: Do not show settings when ran from command line
* All: Run PyPy to slice a model instead of normal python
* All: Changing "Perimeter width over thickness (ratio)" into "Perimeter width".
	With 5D machines this makes more sense, as you have good control over the width.
* All: Save settings in .skeinforge_pypy to not mess up normal skeinforge profiles.
* All: Default settings changed to match Ultimaker with dimension firmware (Marlin or Sprinter)
* All: Modified "Object first layer speed" settings to work on the first 3 layers (configurable)
* SF45: Added "Object first layer travel speed" setting, to slow down the travel on the first layers.
	Reduces the chance that a travel pulls the first layer lose.
* SF41: Dimensions patch against short pauses
* SF41: Speedup patch in euclidean.py (Merged in mainline SF43)

====Bugs====
The graphical analize plugins don't work (Skeinlayer and Skeiniso)

====How does it work====
The user interface still runs in normal python (as PyPy with TK is a bit hard to build, especially for windows), and when you slice it will run command line PyPy to slice the model.
