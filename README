(Old README, is outdated!)

SkeinPyPy is a patched version of Skeinforge. Made to make use of PyPy in combination with Skeinforge easier.
It's also packaged with a customized version of PrintRun. To make a compleet software package.

It's best to use this package with the Marlin firmware. See: http://wiki.ultimaker.com/Skeinforge_PyPy

====How to use===
Download the package for your operating system.

Windows:
	Double click the "skeinforge.bat" for Skeinforge, this can be used to slice your models into GCode.
	Double click the "Printrun.bat" for "PrintRun" this is a graphical command&control interface for your printer. This can run the generated GCode.

Linux/MacOSX: (experimental, no packaged python)
	First you'll need to have python installed on your system! With pyserial when you want to use PrintRun. You do not need pypy, this is packaged with SkeinPyPy
	Then run SkeinPyPy/skeinforge_application/skeinforge.py for skeinforge to slice your model
	Or run printrun\\pronterface.py for the PrintRun interface to print your model

====What is changed====
* Do not show settings when ran from command line
* Run PyPy to slice a model instead of normal python
* Changing "Perimeter width over thickness (ratio)" into "Perimeter width".
	With 5D machines this makes more sense, as you have good control over the width.
* Save settings in .skeinforge_pypy to not mess up normal skeinforge profiles.
* Default settings changed to match Ultimaker with dimension firmware (Marlin or Sprinter) and PLA.
* Modified "Object first layer speed" settings to work on the first 3 layers (configurable)
* Added "Object first layer travel speed" setting, to slow down the travel on the first layers.
	Reduces the chance that a travel pulls the first layer lose.

====Bugs====
The graphical analize plugins don't work (Skeinlayer and Skeiniso)

====How does it work====
The user interface still runs in normal python (as PyPy with TK is a bit hard to build, especially for windows),
	and when you slice it will run command line PyPy to slice the model.
