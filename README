Skeinforge_PyPy is a set of patches for different versions of Skeinforge. Made to make use of PyPy easier.
The code consists out of a few patches and a build script.

The final result is a release package for Windows which should be ready to run without any additional requirements.

====What is changed====
* All: Do not show settings when ran from command line
* All: Run PyPy to slice a model instead of normal python
* SF41: Dimensions patch against short pauses
* SF41: Speedup patch in euclidean.py (Merged in mainline SF43)

====Bugs====
The graphical analize plugins don't work (Skeinlayer and Skeiniso)

====How does it work===
The user interface still runs in normal python (as PyPy with TK is a bit hard to build, especially for windows), and when you slice it will run command line PyPy to slice the model.
