The code in this sub package originates from the Cura project (https://github.com/daid/Cura). It has been
slightly reorganized. The mapping to the original Cura source is the following:

* avr_isp.* => Cura.avr_isp.*
* comm => Cura.util.machineCom
* gcodeInterpreter => Cura.util.gcodeInterpreter
* profile => Cura.util.profile
* resources => Cura.util.resources
* util3d => Cura.util.util3d
* version => Cura.util.version

In the future "profile" and "version" are to be replaced by custom implementations.
